The traces in this directory have had all their data values and memory addresses
set to 0, and, as a result, they are 25 times smaller than the traces with data
values and memory addresses.  If you need the traces with data values and memory
addresses, they total approximately 550 megabytes, and you will need to download
them separately and place them in the directory traces/with-values.
